# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Transcript Analytics Platform is a modern Next.js 15 web application that provides comprehensive predictive analytics for client transcript data with machine learning capabilities. The platform supports multiple data import methods (CSV, Excel, Google Sheets), stores data in PostgreSQL, and provides an interactive dashboard with real-time analytics. The system includes multi-provider authentication, role-based access control, and performance monitoring capabilities.

4. WHEN data is stored THEN the system SHALL use Neon DB as the primary PostgreSQL database for all data operations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a business user, I want to generate ML-powered predictions for transcript volumes with confidence intervals, so that I can make data-driven resource planning decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests predictions THEN the system SHALL use TensorFlow.js to generate forecasts for daily/weekly/monthly volumes
2. WHEN predictions are calculated THEN the system SHALL display confidence intervals, accuracy metrics, and model performance indicators
3. WHEN displaying predictions THEN the system SHALL visualize forecast vs. actual data in interactive charts
4. WHEN model training occurs THEN the system SHALL use in-browser or server-side ML processing for optimal performance

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a business user, I want to enter daily transcript data through a Google Sheets-like interface, so that I can efficiently manage data with familiar spreadsheet functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the data entry interface THEN the system SHALL provide a spreadsheet-like grid interface with cell editing and validation
2. WHEN a user enters data THEN the system SHALL auto-save changes and sync to Neon DB with real-time validation
3. WHEN data is submitted THEN the system SHALL validate using Zod schemas and provide immediate feedback
4. WHEN validation errors occur THEN the system SHALL highlight problematic cells and provide clear correction guidance

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a business user, I want to view interactive dashboards with real-time charts and analytics, so that I can gain comprehensive insights and export data for reporting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the analytics dashboard THEN the system SHALL display real-time charts using Recharts, D3.js, or Chart.js
2. WHEN filtering data THEN the system SHALL provide date range, client, and transcript type filters for drill-down analytics
3. WHEN viewing summary statistics THEN the system SHALL show average transcripts/day, peak load times, and client-specific breakdowns
4. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL generate PDF and CSV reports with selected analytics

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to use Neon DB as the primary PostgreSQL database, so that data can be stored reliably and scaled efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL connect to Neon DB (PostgreSQL) with proper connection pooling and SSL
2. WHEN data operations occur THEN the system SHALL use Neon DB for all CRUD operations with proper indexing and query optimization
3. WHEN database schema changes are needed THEN the system SHALL support migrations using Neon DB's PostgreSQL features
4. WHEN scaling is required THEN the system SHALL leverage Neon DB's serverless PostgreSQL capabilities for automatic scaling

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to be built with modern UI components and animations, so that users have an engaging and professional experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any UI component is rendered THEN the system SHALL use Shadcn UI components for consistent design
2. WHEN page transitions occur THEN the system SHALL display smooth micro animations
3. WHEN forms are interacted with THEN the system SHALL provide animated feedback for focus states and validation
4. WHEN loading states are active THEN the system SHALL show animated loading indicators

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want comprehensive performance monitoring and alerting, so that I can ensure optimal system performance and quickly identify issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs THEN the system SHALL collect performance metrics (queries/sec, model runtime, data sync latency)
2. WHEN performance issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide an admin dashboard for monitoring application health
3. WHEN data sync fails THEN the system SHALL generate alerts and provide error details for troubleshooting
4. WHEN ML model errors occur THEN the system SHALL log model performance and provide health status indicators

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a business user, I want efficient data fetching and state management, so that the application performs well and provides a responsive experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is requested THEN the system SHALL use TanStack Query for caching and background updates
2. WHEN component state changes THEN the system SHALL use React useState for local state management
3. WHEN data is cached THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate cache invalidation strategies
4. IF network requests fail THEN the system SHALL provide retry mechanisms and error boundaries

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a business user, I want to upload historical transcript data in multiple formats, so that I can easily migrate existing data into the platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN uploading files THEN the system SHALL support CSV and Excel (.xlsx) file formats
2. WHEN processing uploads THEN the system SHALL validate data format and provide detailed error reports for invalid data
3. WHEN import completes THEN the system SHALL display import summary with success/failure counts and data preview
4. WHEN data conflicts exist THEN the system SHALL provide options to merge, replace, or skip conflicting records

### Requirement 11

**User Story:** As an analyst, I want to generate and view ML predictions with detailed model performance metrics, so that I can assess prediction reliability and make informed decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating predictions THEN the system SHALL use TensorFlow.js with multiple model types (linear, polynomial, ARIMA)
