# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Transcript Analytics Platform is a Next.js 15 web application that provides predictive analytics for client transcript data. The platform integrates with Google Sheets as a data source, implements SSO authentication, and uses machine learning to predict future transcript volumes. The application features a modern UI with micro animations and comprehensive data visualization capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a business user, I want to authenticate using Single Sign-On (SSO), so that I can securely access the platform without managing separate credentials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the application THEN the system SHALL present an SSO login option using OAuth providers (Auth0, Firebase, or similar)
2. WHEN a user successfully authenticates THEN the system SHALL grant access to the main application dashboard
3. WHEN a user's session expires THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the login page
4. IF a user is not authenticated THEN the system SHALL prevent access to protected routes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a business user, I want to view historical transcript data for all clients, so that I can understand past performance and trends.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display historical transcript data for all clients over the past 13 months
2. WHEN displaying data THEN the system SHALL show client names and their corresponding transcript counts per month
3. WHEN data is loading THEN the system SHALL display animated loading states
4. IF no data is available THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate empty state message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a business user, I want to see predictive analytics for future transcript volumes, so that I can plan resources and make informed business decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests predictions THEN the system SHALL generate forecasts for upcoming months using time-series or regression models
2. WHEN predictions are calculated THEN the system SHALL display confidence intervals and accuracy metrics
3. WHEN displaying predictions THEN the system SHALL use charts and visualizations to present the data clearly
4. IF insufficient historical data exists THEN the system SHALL notify the user and suggest minimum data requirements

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a business user, I want to input additional transcript data, so that I can keep the system updated with the latest information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the data input form THEN the system SHALL provide validated input fields for client name and transcript count
2. WHEN a user submits new data THEN the system SHALL validate the input using Zod schemas
3. WHEN data is successfully submitted THEN the system SHALL update the Google Sheet and refresh the dashboard
4. IF validation fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages with guidance for correction

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a business user, I want to see trends, charts, and analytics, so that I can gain insights from the transcript data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the analytics section THEN the system SHALL display interactive charts showing trends over time
2. WHEN displaying charts THEN the system SHALL include options for different time ranges and client filtering
3. WHEN charts are rendered THEN the system SHALL use smooth animations for transitions and updates
4. WHEN a user hovers over data points THEN the system SHALL display detailed tooltips with relevant information

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to integrate with Google Sheets API, so that data can be synchronized and managed efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL establish connection to Google Sheets API
2. WHEN data is requested THEN the system SHALL fetch current data from the configured Google Sheet
3. WHEN new data is added THEN the system SHALL append it to the Google Sheet
4. IF API limits are reached THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate retry mechanisms and error handling

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to be built with modern UI components and animations, so that users have an engaging and professional experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any UI component is rendered THEN the system SHALL use Shadcn UI components for consistent design
2. WHEN page transitions occur THEN the system SHALL display smooth micro animations
3. WHEN forms are interacted with THEN the system SHALL provide animated feedback for focus states and validation
4. WHEN loading states are active THEN the system SHALL show animated loading indicators

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a business stakeholder, I want the option to migrate from Google Sheets to a database, so that the system can scale with growing data requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data volume increases THEN the system SHALL support migration to PostgreSQL or MongoDB
2. WHEN using a database THEN the system SHALL maintain the same API interface for data operations
3. WHEN migration occurs THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing data and functionality
4. IF performance issues arise with Google Sheets THEN the system SHALL provide clear migration guidance

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a business user, I want efficient data fetching and state management, so that the application performs well and provides a responsive experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is requested THEN the system SHALL use TanStack Query for caching and background updates
2. WHEN component state changes THEN the system SHALL use React useState for local state management
3. WHEN data is cached THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate cache invalidation strategies
4. IF network requests fail THEN the system SHALL provide retry mechanisms and error boundaries
