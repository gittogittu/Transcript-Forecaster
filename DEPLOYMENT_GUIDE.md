# Optional: Monitoring & Alerting
SENTRY_DSN=https://your-sentry-dsn@sentry.io/project-id
LOGGING_ENDPOINT=https://your-logging-service.com/api/logs
LOGGING_API_KEY=your-logging-api-key
ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/your-webhook-url
```

### 2. Set Up Authentication

Follow the detailed setup in `AUTH_SETUP.md`:
- Configure your OAuth provider (Auth0, Firebase, etc.)
- Set up callback URLs
- Configure user permissions

### 3. Set Up Google Sheets Integration

Follow the detailed setup in `GOOGLE_SHEETS_SETUP.md`:
- Create Google Cloud Project
- Enable Google Sheets API
- Create service account
- Share your spreadsheet with the service account

## 🚀 Deployment Options

### Option 1: Vercel (Recommended)

1. **Install Vercel CLI**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. **Deploy using the deployment script**:
   ```bash
   node scripts/deploy.js --environment production
   ```

3. **Or deploy manually**:
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

### Option 2: Manual Deployment

1. **Build the application**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Start the production server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Option 3: CI/CD Pipeline

The application includes a complete GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`) that automatically:

1. Runs quality checks (linting, type checking)
2. Executes comprehensive test suite
3. Performs security audits
4. Builds and optimizes the application
5. Runs E2E and performance tests
6. Deploys to staging/production
7. Validates deployment health

**To use CI/CD:**

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Set up the following secrets in your GitHub repository:
   - `VERCEL_TOKEN`
   - `VERCEL_ORG_ID`
   - `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`
   - All environment variables from your `.env.production.local`

3. The pipeline will automatically deploy on push to `main` branch

## 🔍 Post-Deployment Validation

After deployment, run the validation script to ensure everything is working:

```bash
node scripts/post-deployment-validation.js --url https://your-domain.com
```

This script validates:
- ✅ Basic connectivity and response times
- ✅ API endpoints accessibility
- ✅ Security headers implementation
- ✅ Authentication flow
- ✅ Monitoring system functionality
- ✅ Performance metrics

## 📊 Monitoring & Maintenance

### Production Monitoring

The application includes comprehensive monitoring capabilities:

- **Performance Monitoring**: Optional real-time performance metrics and Web Vitals (can be enabled manually)
- **Error Tracking**: Structured error logging with detailed context and timestamps
- **User Analytics**: Usage patterns and feature adoption
- **Security Monitoring**: Rate limiting and security event tracking
- **Validation Monitoring**: Field-level validation errors with detailed reporting

#### Enabling Performance Monitoring

Performance monitoring is disabled by default to optimize initial bundle size. To enable it:

```typescript
// In your application code where needed
import { initializePerformanceMonitoring } from '@/lib/monitoring/performance-monitor'

// Initialize performance monitoring
initializePerformanceMonitoring()
```

Or use the React hook for component-level monitoring:

```typescript
import { usePerformanceMonitor } from '@/lib/monitoring/performance-monitor'

function MyComponent() {
  const { startMonitoring } = usePerformanceMonitor()
  
  useEffect(() => {
    startMonitoring()
  }, [])
}
```

### Health Checks

Monitor these endpoints:
- `GET /api/monitoring/events` - Application health status
- `GET /` - Main application availability
- `GET /api/transcripts` - API functionality (requires auth)

### Performance Optimization

The application includes several performance optimizations:
- Code splitting and lazy loading
- Optional performance monitoring (disabled by default for faster startup)
- Service worker for offline functionality (can be initialized on-demand)
- Optimized bundle sizes with tree shaking
- Efficient caching strategies
- Image optimization
- Dynamic imports for heavy libraries (TensorFlow.js, monitoring tools)

## 🔄 Database Migration (Future)

When ready to migrate from Google Sheets to a database:

1. Set up your database (PostgreSQL recommended)
2. Configure `DATABASE_URL` in environment variables
3. Run migration scripts:
   ```bash
   node src/lib/migration/migration-cli.js
   ```
4. Update data source configuration
5. Test thoroughly before switching over

## 🧪 Testing in Production

### Automated Testing

The application includes comprehensive test coverage:
- **Unit Tests**: Component and utility function testing
- **Integration Tests**: API and data flow testing
- **E2E Tests**: Complete user workflow testing
- **Performance Tests**: Load and response time testing
- **Accessibility Tests**: WCAG compliance testing

### Manual Testing Checklist

   - Validate API credentials format

4. **Performance Issues**
   - Monitor bundle sizes with `ANALYZE=true npm run build`
   - Check for memory leaks in prediction engine
   - Optimize database queries if using database

### Getting Help

- Check the application logs for detailed error messages
- Review the monitoring dashboard for performance insights
- Consult the comprehensive test suite for expected behavior
- Use the post-deployment validation script for health checks
